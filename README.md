Hi my name is Vivian. I initially pursued a career is health science. However, I realized it was not for me during my journey through nursing school. I decided to explore a new path and found coding to be more creative,yet puzzling at the same time. Admittingly it can be frustrating, I especiallly enjoy the idea that codes are usually broken until fixed.
